# Collective Motion
Active matter refers to systems that are not in equilibrium and continuously consume energy. Examples of such systems include flocks of birds,
bacterial colonies, and vehicular traffic. These systems often exhibit collective motion, 
where individual components move coherently without an external field or specific geometric constraints.
## The Vicsek Model
Introduced by Vicsek in 1995, the Vicsek model describes the dynamics of self-propelled particles. 
Each particle in the model adjusts its direction of motion based on the average direction of its neighbors within a certain radius, 
with some added noise to simulate real-life uncertainties.
## Model Dynamics

Where:
- θ_i is the direction of motion.
- v_0 is the speed.
- η is the noise strength.
- ξ_i represents random fluctuations.

## Phase Transition
The Vicsek model shows a phase transition from disordered to ordered states as the noise decreases.
In the ordered phase, particles move coherently in the same direction, while in the disordered phase,
their motion is random. This transition is quantified by an order parameter similar to magnetization in the Ising model.
